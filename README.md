# StudyHawk

**StudyHawk** allows users to create study decks and study the flashcards within them. They will be able to create multiple decks of cards, and in each deck, the user will be able to create flashcards. These cards will allow the user to add a term and a definition to the cards, as well as a picture if the user chooses.

**StudyHawk** solves the issues that Quizlet has regarding paywalls and gives users (students at Miami University) a good place to study their work.
